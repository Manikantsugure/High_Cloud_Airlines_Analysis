# High Cloud Airlines – Flight Data Analysis & Route Optimization
This project analyzes airline flight data to identify high-traffic routes, optimize load factor efficiency, and compare carrier performance.  
Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to provide dynamic insights into route efficiency, passenger occupancy, and operational performance.
## Key Insights
- Load Factor % by Year, Quarter, Month
- Top 10 Carriers by Passengers
- Top Routes (Origin → Destination) by Flights
- Weekend vs Weekday Occupancy
- Flights by Distance Group
- KPI Cards: Total Passengers, Average Load Factor %, Total Flights
- Dynamic filtering by Origin/Destination & Carrier
- Route optimization insights using conditional formatting and maps
